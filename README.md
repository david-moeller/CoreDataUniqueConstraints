# CoreDataUniqueConstraints

This is a sample project for setting up unique constraints in Core Data with a migration from a pre-existing model without unique constraints. It handles a case where there are existing duplicates that would violate the unique constraint when applied.


This project is a fork of an original project for adding unique constraints in Core Data. The original/base project was created with a link to the following blog post:
